      	<div class="reading">Lots of welcome news on the buzz front this week for those of us who love our morning with an extra shot of caffeine. First, Starbucks going head to head with Red Bull with "Refreshers" energy drinks. It will be interesting to see how this plays out and how their new string of all natural juice cafes impact their core coffee business. And now a handheld espresso press that looks sleek enough to fit in 007's arsenal of cool devices. Pick your poison. </div>

      	<div class="reading">Planning my daughter's fourth birthday party has unleashed my inner entertaining diva. She's been hiding since the holidays it seems. It's a welcome shift, and I think a timely one since spring has arrived.
So in the course of planning a fete for a dozen squealing children I've been plotting and planning my seasonal tablescapes. A few items I think are key to keep your tabletop seasonal but not "theme-y" when entertaining.
1. Fresh flowers. Need I say more? I suggest a massive bouquet of either a singular color or a single variety of flower. Let the blooms speak for themselves.
2. Colorful place settings. Have fun here, especially for dining al fresco. Spring is all about color.
3. A clear glass decanter or apothecary jar filled with... anything! I love these with candies, fruits or pretty objects. Don't overthink this. A few blooms floating in water look lovely as well.
4. Pillows. Yes... you're dining outside, but that's no reason to leave guests in search of comfort.
5. Adorn the front door with a wreath. Set the tone from the moment company arrives... it'll lay the foundation for a festive gathering.
6. Vintage inspired birdcages. These are lovely and make for clever tabletop centerpieces if you place candles inside. I suggest flameless pillars to transform these into gorgeous lanterns.
The key to any spring affair... relax. It's advice I need to heed myself. Guests can't unwind and enjoy if the host is uptight or rushed. Plan, plan, plan ahead... but by all means on the day of the party be sure the only thing you need to style is your hair. ;)
Gorgeous items above all from Joss &amp; Main.</div>

      	<div class="reading"> The biggest adjustment I had to make when we moved to Texas was adjusting to the massive scale of the rooms inside of homes. Frankly, I'm still adjusting. It's not that yards are larger... but in Texas, bigger really is better and size does matter.
It comes down to volume. High ceilings, more square footage and what can seem live cavernous rooms. It's amazing - but quite a lot to adjust to when you've been conditioned to expect to need more petite furnishings or "regular scale" pieces. Such is not the case here. Go big - really big - or go home.
Of course this isn't everywhere or every home... and this certainly isn't the case in major cities across america. In light of this, it's nice (and savvy business practice) to see companies like Restoration Hardware offer more petite options. If you've shopped their showrooms you know how outrageously large their furniture and accessories can be.
But just today they released an email featuring what they call Big Style, Small Spaces. Those of you with a pied-à-terre or even just a normal home will certainly delight in the new collection! </div>

I was admiring the Tory Burch estate photos the way one admires overly fussy cuisine. I liked it. I appreciated it for all its complexity... but it just wasn't to my taste. Patterns... lots of them. Prints. Chintz. And more pedigreed pieces than most people will encounter in their time here on earth.
And then... I happened upon these photos of her pool house and the grandeur that is her outdoor living space. Consider me sold. I decided right then and there that if I had to take this property as-is I would do it just for the phenomenal poolside lifestyle.
Might I add... the property is stunning. Absolutely stunning... I would just need to start anew with the interior design to live there myself. But Tory... what a lovely retreat you've created for yourself. I applaud your incredible success and the incredible life you have created for yourself. And as for that pool house? I do hope you entertain their frequently... it's a magical addition to your home. </div>

<p>While I'm not your typical full blown Kate Spade fan, I do love her ability to consistently churn out poppy, happy items. Her latest foray into home goods that serve up Jonathan Adler-worthy "anti-depressive" items is her Florence Broadhurst collection. Be sure to check out the full décor shop to see just how positively cheerful this basic pairing of colors can be when used to display Japanese blossoms. It's downright giddy if you ask me!</p>My pick? The tableware, of course. And while there is no espresso cup available, I love the idea of adding these "tidbit" plates to serving arsenal for a party. </div>

      	<div class="reading">Because I (and I'm guessing you as well) can't resist an opportunity to peer into a fabulous closet, may I offer you a glimpse into the master closet of this $6.5MM University Park listing. The home itself is just under 9,000 square feet and is in one of my favorite parts of Dallas.
Yahoo describes the home (and mostly the closet) this way:

This house, built in 2007, almost looks like a converted warehouse from  outside. Highlights include an underground garage, marble floors and  fireplaces, and a geothermal HVAC system. The master bedroom has his and  hers baths, along with this enormous closet with high ceilings. The  closet has shelving for shoes and cowboy boots, as well as overhead storage for hats and out-of-season clothing.

I will say, Dallas homes have some of the best closets I've ever seen. We are willing to have smallish yards in order to accommodate our need for generous square footage inside the home and maximum storage space. For more fabulous real estate drool sessions, be sure to peruse one of my favorite sites, Mathews Nichols for some of the city's finer examples of luxury homes. This listing ought to get you started. Note the insanely pretty kitchen and dreamy back patio. This is what living in the South is all about. </div>

      	<div class="reading">Celebrity designer Christian Louboutin's highly anticipated capsule collection is now available. Twenty shoes to celebrate twenty years of craftsmanship and artistry. And - it bears mentioning - six celebratory bags.
I am absolutely swooning over the illustrations - far more than the anniversary collection shoes themselves. There's no denying he is a force of nature too powerful to be stopped. Here's a man who knows how to absolutely seduce an audience. Not only would I gladly take a closet filled with his shoes, I'd love a few walls adorned with his illustrations as well. The question is... which is more closely regarded as art? The conceptual sketch or the real thing? You be the judge.

       	<div class="reading">We American girls seem to have our spa days with a side order of guilt. I'm not sure why that's the case. Our European counterparts understand that regular renewal and relaxation is the best anti-aging system. We rush, rush rush from one "urgent" affar to the next and "squeeze in" beauty appointments as necessary.
In light of this knowledge I've made it a point to begin to regularly and consistently make time for "me" - sans the guilt. Luckily... those $50 SpaWeek services make this even easier. SpaWeek doesn't officially begin until April 16th... but I'm getting a sneak peek this week of what's in store for all of us.
Sunday morning I'll be headed down to The Spa at The Crescent at Rosewood Crescent Hotel. This is one of Dallas's most incredible hospitality properties, so I'm very excited to indulge in the spa amenities. And let me assure you... I'll soak in every indulgent moment.
What is this opulent spa offering at an attractive $50 price point? Three perfectly pampering services:

 50 Min Spa Week Body Package Including Organic Hydrating Scrub and Bath 
50 Min Spa Week Hydrating Facial 
50 Min Spa Week Signature Pedicure and Paraffin Foot Treatment 

Those of you in Dallas should follow suit and book a few appointments at the Crescent. Once I'm buffed an polished to perfection I'll share my experience with you. Those of you elsewhere should pop over to SpaWeek to discover the luxurious spa opportunities in your city. And please... leave the guilt at home. As a woman it is your duty and your right to care for yourself. </div>

<p>The funny thing about living in the south is that swimming pools are never drained, it rarely snows and suddenly you're faced with the realization that there just won't be what one would consider "winter" weather.</p>
<p>It's March and I'm keenly aware that we desperately need patio furniture. Dining furniture. The catch? As much as I love bronze cast aluminum like this gorgeous Antibes collection from Restoration Hardware it has one glaring flaw: that metal will be unbearably hot to touch come summer. When it hits 114 outside and the Texas sun shows up to cast its glow upon my house... you might as well have a branding iron in your had. Hot. Like. Fire.</p>
<p>And yet... I love this set. I want it. I adore it. It looks remarkably like the collection from Century that I adore... but the price point on this set is much sweeter (always the selling point for the Mr. in my life). </p>
<p>Fellow southerners... ar you rocking teak or wicker rather than cast aluminum?</p>

Now seeing this... I'm intrigued and a bit excited. These are so insanely wild they look downright wearable. Not to mention sexy. Maybe now you'll know what footwear to put on at that garden wedding you've been invited to this spring. After all, a girl can't risk getting a normal pair of shoes wet. But these?

       	<div class="reading">Ahhh, fragrance. Is there any faster way to alter a mood and a mindset? I think not. While there are as many different scents out there as there are preferences, one thing is certain: finding one that speaks to you and "moves" you is key.
One think many women (and men) overlook is the variety of methods for applying personal fragrance. Are you a scented powder kid of girl, a solid parfum person or a body oil babe? The difference in quality and enjoyment of the fragrance based upon the application might surprise and delight you.
I find it most rewarding to layer my scents, thereby creating my own unique fragrance. Try this: Bobbi Brown's Beach Oil followed by Gucci II eau de toilette (now discontinued, but I have my own stash!) with a dab of Tocca Brigitte solid perfume on the insides of your wrist. Result: aromatic intoxication... in the best possible way.
For the uninitiated... don't miss out on one of life's true great pleasures. Frédéric Malle's line of fragrances is a mesmerizing blend of high-tech innovation and the best natural extractions of exotic (and familiar) essences. Introductions like Carnal Flower are impossible to describe in words. Suffice it to say, the 18 lengthy months it took to create the fragrance was well worth it. You (and your romantic interest) will be thrilled you experimented with this mind blowing aroma. It's like nothing you've ever tried before. Rush to your local Barneys counter and sample the goods. It's worth the effort.
The best tip I can offer you about selecting your own unique fragrance is this: choose on that YOU love. Never wear a fragrance for someone else. If it makes you feel romantic or powerful or sophisticated or dangerous... if it moves you, alters your state and makes you feel amazing: by all means wear it! Remember nothing is as appealing as confidence, and when you find your small stable of mood altering scents consider yourself armed for any challenge life (or love) may toss your way.

This glittery, pink, festive confection is only available from February 9th thru 16th, so you'll need to grab one fast. Luckily you'll need the sugar rush to keep up with this itinerary. For those like me who are device addicted, the only app you'll need (as your savor your cupcake) is Fashion GPS. A worthwhile treat for your tastebuds and your iPhone!  Oh, and not to worry about excess carbs or calories from the tasty pink treat. These little pink creations are teeny, tiny... just like the runway models who love them! </div>

I could never understand the girls who grumbled and griped about Valentine's Day. As they day approached they grew more bitter. Truth is, these were pessimestic people to begin with... and the impending day of romance was just one more excuse to draw attention to their distaste for life in general.
The thing is, romance is a lot like joy and happiness. It's your responsibility - not that of someone else to manifest this in your life. It's something you experience, not something someone does for you. Frankly, some of my best Valentine's Day were those I enjoyed as a single girl. It's a day when you can add a bit more lip gloss, higher heels, have a bit more of a spring in your step, wear pink without irony and - yes, even buy yourself a massive bouquet of your favorite Stargazer lilies.
Being happy and embracing your femininity is your responsibility. Waiting on some white knight to "rescue" you is putting undue responsibility on someone else. Joy and satisfaction comes from within. And how could you be anything less than happy in a deliciously pink pencil skirt?.
So I say, single or not, treat yourself to something fun this holiday. Maybe it's a tube of gorgeous gloss. A pedicure. Maybe it's a handbag you've been coveting. Maybe it's dinner and drinks with the girls... maybe it's just some time out for yoga. Whatever it is, realize that the onus is on you to manifest your own happiness today and every day in life. Not that of Mr. Right. 


Frankly, nothing is more appealing to a man than a confident, happy, self-satisfied woman. So be that woman. And in festive pink with a broad smile on your glowing face, you'll be hard to miss and impossible to resist.</div>

       	<div class="reading">Suffice it to say: she rocked the house. I have never been impressed with a halftime show, but seeing Madonna in all her Givenchy and Philip Treacy glory had me on the edge of my seat. She looked gorgeous, glamorous and - perhaps best of all - as though she was having the time of her life. I mean, if you are carried in on a golden throne being held by 100+ buffed and bronzed centurions, surely you should be wearing a smile that bright. That, dear readers, is how a true performer entertains a massive live audience.
While I could go on and on about her appearance (stunning) and her glorious outfits (incredible), I'd be doing you a disservice. For an in depth study of her sartorial choices, be sure to see Nice Verreos's post on last night's Super Bowl costumes. There he dissects her costumes and discusses her wise choice of using stylist Bea Åkerlund to craft her look.
And since I know you're eager to do so, you can pre-order the new MDNA album here.
