Don't sweat it Just get it. This is my shopping motto today and always. Having worked retail early in life, I don't go near a mall the day after Christmas. Isn't that what online shopping is all about, anyway? I can shop in my jammies propped up against my headboard while others brave the cold and the crowds.For those of you like me, here's a roundup of some of the more notable online style deals to be had. Enjoy! </p>

        <p> File this under the "why wasn't this possible before?" category. Waterworks, quite possibly the ultimate in kitchen and bath outfitters, now offers an online shopping experience for customers. If you've never ventured into one of these incredible showrooms, this might not mean much to you. Lately they've been given a bit of press on television. Million Dollar Decorators stopped into a showroom, as did Guiliana and Bill in an episode in a recent season.
If you're redesigning your kitchen or bath - or are seeking an excuse to do so - you're in for a true treat. These are some of the loveliest fittings, fixtures, tubs and surfaces you're likely to find anywhere. While I hadn't noticed before, the online offerings feature apothecary products, furniture and lighting.
Before you start demolishing your fabulous kitchen on a food-centric holiday let me urge you to stop. Sit back and enjoy the feast with family and friends. Tomorrow when your local Waterworks showroom opens you can indulge in your remodeling fantasies. Besides... you don't want to buy a soaking tub online, do you? No. You don't.
Until the shops open mañana you should stay offline and enjoy the day of fabulous company. And you current kitchen and baths. Trust me... those fittings and surfaces will still be there tomorrow.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!</p>

While there are a few strong voices out there in men's fashion blogging (just what is James wearing today, anyway?), by and large the focus is on women and - by default - womenswear. But what about the handsome gents in our lives and their knack for timeless appear or their surprising capacity to rival Chuck bass in the "how on earth did he concoct that look?" sartorial department? We must stand back and take notice (maybe stare for a moment) and the wonder that is men's fashion.
If you're new to the fashion scene and need a primer, I recommend some basic volumes for your reading pleasure. "Anything Other Than Naked" by Glen Sondag will help you navigate the perils of suit shopping and easily address any fashion etiquette concerns you might have. A 200 level course might be Nordstrom's "Guide to Men's Style" produced with input from fashion insider Tom Julian which goes well beyond the suit and delves into savvy fabric choices, emergency cleaning tips and even ways to care for your hard earned investment apparel.
Seeking a historic look back at the suit's origins and what fine clothiers have to offer? I always love giving Rizzoli's "Bespoke" as a gift. The gender of the recipient seems irrelevant here. Men adore this as a showy coffee table book. Girlfriends will actually read it. Fashion lovers of any gender will devour it, as most of us have an interest in the legendary Savile Row and their impeccable custom tailoring. Besides... having a foreword by Tom Ford never hurt a publication's marketability.
So what about you, or the man in your life? Are you living in a world of khaki pants and French blue shirts? Or is it all about French cuffs and heavily creased dress pants? What about those more dapper options that our dashing designer friend James Andrew sports? James's style in particular is the result of years of practice, an innate sense of style and a desire to outdo himself every day. And he does it with aplomb.Not every man can pull this off without irony.
Most men I know (husband included) venture about as far as Roger Berman (aka Mrs. Rachel Zoe), that is: an artfully wrapped neck scarf paired with a good looking jacket jacket. Which - by the way - is not a bad thing. The resulting look is masculine, modern and takes him from meetings to dinner without a costume change.
What about you or the man in your life? And what goes under the tree this year? Cufflinks or khakis?</p>

        <p>If this dress guide from Neiman's doesn't have you eager to put on a pretty party dress, nothing will. 'Tis the season for fabulous frocks and even prettier shoes. The "Art of the dress" guide showcases Marchesa Couture, Monique Lhullier, Pamella Roland and Naeem Khan - something for everyone. For me it is the Lhullier dress that has me swooning. Whatever your style, pop on over and get in the festive spirit while admiring some incredibly pretty pieces. No invited in your mailbox? These might motivate you to be the belle of your own ball.</p>

First, you should be on pinterest. Next you and I should be following one another. Otherwise, you're missing out on some really remarkable daily inspiration.
You see, facebook often shares too much about your acquaintances, strangers and friends. I need not know your political leanings or how angry this or that made you. Save it. Twitter, on the other hand, tells us how they live their daily lives, moment to moment. I actually do love the granularity and "real life" insight this medium offers.
But what I love about Pinterest is that it showcases what people dream of, what they love, who they aspire to be, what they aspire to do and more importantly how they see their best themselves. It's visual. It's brief. It's uplifting and it's almost entirely without negativity. As of this writing, Pinterest offers me  the very best of a person and their inner self. And for a visually dominant person like myself, it's the ultimate way to "see" what another person visualizes or wants to visualize. The photography based nature of the app makes it resonate with me in a way that no text-based social media app ever could. I love it.
So go. Pin. Enjoy. I hope you derive as much visual pleasure form it as I do. Happy pinning!

<p><br><br><br>A lot goes into manufacturing beautiful, durable, quality furniture. So imagine the challenge of designing tables, chairs and beds to remain outdoors 24/7 for all twelve months of the year. Oh.. AND make them look and feel just as fabulous as your indoor furniture. It just can't be easy.</p>
<p>Lane Venture was another stop on Elaine Williamson's High Point Showroom tour and she was blown away by the gorgeous collections and the quality. I should have warned her... it's stunning! They even have a collection by Celerie Kemble that makes my stylish heart skip a beat. I had the pleasure of working with the Lane Venture team a few seasons back and was so impressed not only with their furniture, but with their commitment to quality and continuous improvements.</p>
<p>Note the shot of gorgeous Elaine above in their new balloon chair. How perfect for a sunny poolside afternoon! Although it's hard to think "outdoor living spaces" when the mercury is dropping outside... this really is the time to start planning and shopping for the warmer months. </p>
<p>Lane Venture is known for their world famous WeatherMaster line that can resist pretty much anything Mother Nature has up her clever sleeve. Top those frames with beautiful Sunbrella or Outdura fabrics and you're set. Bring on the elements!</p>
<p><br>They may be the "go to" source for weatherproof rattan, but many of their frames come fully upholstered. Check out this beauty. Could you die? It brings outdoor leisure to an entirely new level if you ask me. There's even a full assortment of dining options with this look. LOVE!</p>
<p>Thanks again, Elaine, for the skinny on all that was new and marvelous at Market. Thrilled you and your crew of StyleSpotters had such a marvelous time! xoxo</p>

Couturier Christian Lacroix recently stepped away from the world of runway design to focus on a very different style of fashion: costumes. His current focus is designing for Paris’ Opéra Garnier, but the next few years see him globetrotting and digging into new and varied avenues of design.
While every outfit is to some degree a costume for life, there is a wide gulf between delicate haute couture gowns and performance apparel for a rigorous activity such as dance. Style.com has an interview with the legendary figure and highlights the similarities and differences between the two categories of apparel:

A costume is made to be seen from afar; it has to “speak,” to convey a  character from the moment the performer steps onto the stage. An haute  couture piece is particularly beautiful when it’s right under your nose.The  distance between the stage and the audience is also magnified by light  and the illusion of spectacle. You can improvise by using humble  materials, which you can then patina, trim, and paint, forcing your  point so that from a distance they appear sumptuous. In couture, you  cannot use anything but the highest quality fabrics, embroideries, and  other elements.But the process is the same—for me in any case. I  considered my couture clients heroines of their own lives, and I tried  to create second skins for them that were in harmony with their bodies,  their character, their lifestyle—exactly as for an actor, a prima  ballerina, or an opera star. My fashions were theatrical, operatic,  spectacular, and very akin to stage life. Trends of the moment are of  scant importance to stage creations.

Never one to sit still, the next few years we will see creations from Lacroix for Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme in Paris, a staging of Madame Butterfly in Hamburg, a hotel in Bangkok with Sofitel and even finishing lines 3 and 4 of the Tramway in Montpellier, which will be operational next April. He may have stepped off the runway, but certainly not the treadmill of highly publicized design. It just proves that unstoppable forces of design are just that: unstoppable, regardless of the particular area in which they operate.
Aren't these sketches for the Paris ballet dreamy?</p>

        <p>  Another stop on the High Point Market Blogger tour was Thomasville. It's interesting to note that this brand is available at the retail level, meaning anyone can walk into a Thomasville showroom and make a purchase - no designer required. But for a commercially available line, Thomasville really steps it up when it comes to offering customizable pieces and boasting incredibly chic styles.
Another thing that sets this brand apart is their commitment to offering accessories for the home. Most brands establish a niche in furniture OR accessories... but Thomasville's product lineup says: come here for everything. Including, it should be noted, a really glamorous selection of bedding ensembles and lamps.
This is quite savvy on their part, as normally it's impossible to complete a room while shopping under the roof of a single brand. Rather than visit multiple showrooms and shop for weeks (or give up mid-hunt) you can find hardware, throws, coverlets, mirrors, wall art... you name it - all at a single showroom. By collaborating with designer brands the resulting look is high-end and has the air of a luxury interior designer's fingerprint. This extra merchandise gives customers the freedom to make a space uniquely their own (especially with those hardware options!) and provide for themselves a finished look that fully custom at a price they enjoy.
Here's a great roundup of new introductions for October Market, including two featured collections: Cassara and Spellbound. The latter being especially Venti Approved! See this stunning hall chest for proof of the power of a little glamour in your home.
Special thanks to Elaine Williamson again for being my eyes and ears on this showroom tour. I'm thrilled you enjoyed the showroom and the pieces (she couldn't say enough great things about the bedding!) I also want to note that my company does do work with Thomasville's parent company as well as some of its sister brands... but we do not work specifically for/with Thomasville. Opinions and appreciation all my own :)</p>

        <p> {Photos above property of Mary McDonald's portfolio site}I've been working through Elaine's fabulous photos from High Point Market. So much to see and digest. The main message coming back visually and verbally has been color. Everywhere. In accessories, in fabrics, in everything. Saturated, rich, bold color.
Are we ready? After years of excelling at creating a greige base I'd say we're more than ready. In many cases it's a breeze to add color to your home merely by swapping out pillows, lamp shades, throws and other accents.
Not too many years I rid myself of cranberry (buh-bye!) and traded her in for more serene tones. Now I'm enjoying color on my own terms: Surprising color found on the back of my dining room chairs, large upholstered pieces in glam shades of blue. Yes, I'm embracing color like never before... but this is still not as bold as what's coming at us...  This, ladies and gentlemen... is color. In your face color. The question is... are we ready? I say easily: yes. It doesn't mean we'll all run out and put a marigold modern rug in our home... but the return of color will surely liven up magazine pages, get homeowners rethinking their basics and even adding a lot of fun and energy to the marketplace.
Notice the overlap of runway and hallway... color is appearing at Fashion Week and Market. It's clear we needed a boost of something in our lives (or at least our eyes). I'm loving the availability of shocking hues even if just for the sake of variety.
Stay tuned for Elaine Williamson's full market recap, and follow her on Pinterest to learn more about her StyleSpotting activities while there.</p>

        <p> By now fashionable readers across the globe have all read that haute couture designer Jean Paul Gaultier has opened his Fashion as Art exhibit here in Dallas. Last week's kickoff events featured fabulous private fetes to honor him and exclusive previews of the multimedia display. Jean Paul himself was on hand much to the delight of party goers and the city's most well-heeled.
Those who venture to the Dallas Museum of Art will be wowed by more than 130 of Gaultier’s avant-garde ensembles spanning over 35 years from the designer’s couture and ready-to-wear collections. The remarkable exhibit will showcase these one-of-a-kind masterpieces along with their accessories (I love that extra touch, giving you context) and numerous archival documents (think: conceptual sketches).
Gaultier is known for his over-the-top creations and his provocative point of view. His work has included some of fashion's most recognizable garments like the pointed bustiers of legendary Madonna fame. He is also known for consistently delighting fans and style observers with his boundary crossing fashion confections and fantasy-laden runway experiences. Regardless of your interest in fashion, you must admire him as an artist and risk taker. He fully embodies both.
Like the city of Dallas itself (a city well known for it's commitment to fashion), this is no ordinary exhibit. It is Jean Paul Gaultier, after all. Expect to see truly marvelous works of fashion (represented as art) alongside video clips and musical recordings from shows, concerts, and films - all incorporating his designs. The interactive museum experience features 30 animated mannequins that offer viewers songs and commentary. If you're expecting a quiet moment at a stuffy gallery, this won't be for you.
Dallas is the first of only two U.S. cities on this highly anticipated international tour. I am proud to know that our local fashionably fierce citizens will not let this fact go unnoticed or this event fade away quickly. Tickets are on sale now at dallasmuseumofart.org.

<p><br><br></p>Why is it that designing and completing your own home is many times more difficult than doing it for someone else? I have a few theories. On one hand, the world is your oyster. You can access all the recesses of your mind, catalogues and the internet to source for the perfect this or that. But therein lies the dilemma. Immediately you realize that you only know what you know. The process of learning has the curious effect of indicating to us all that we don't know. At which point the decision making process stalls. <p>
As I scoured the web for specific photos of even more specific things I came across (again) this beautiful Janie Hirsch article on Decorati. While I don't love all of the photos (some are far too rustic for me), Janie has an ease with French influenced pieces that I have long admired. The Atlanta designer manages to create spaces that look "collected" and "perfectly staged" at the same time. The result is relaxed elegance - my favorite look. </p> So as I continue to seek out the ideal lamp tables and oversized rugs I'll always keep looking to images of professionals whose work I admire. It helps me stay on course and reminds me why the quest for the idea piece is of such importance. The lesson: keep learning, keep looking, keep seeking, keep at it. It's always worth it in the end AND throughout the process. Creative fields require you (yes, require you) to continually learn and evolve. The great names in your field didn't get there by lagging behind or refusing to improve their craft. They committed to continuous growth and improvement. If you find yourself swimming in a sea of new information, consider yourself lucky: you've stumbled upon new things to learn! </div>

        <p>  At some point in my extended family's recent past we stopped doing annual holiday gift exchange. Too many unwanted items and under-appreciated gifts. But some objects are always welcome, even if you're just acquiring them for yourself. Case in point: board games. We have two cabinets in our back hallway loaded with games.
Cold weather, rainy days or just evening with friends can turn into festive events if you're prepared for fun. I absolutely love the vintage games they offer a this time of year at Restoration Hardware. Limited editions of classics. It's hard to go wrong here if you're looking for a great gift! The wooden boxes sure beat the flimsy cardboard that they usually come packaged in. Most friends I know would love one of these as a surprise. It's the kind of thing you never buy for yourself but always love having on hand. 
Frankly, even if your family doesn't do gift exchange it's hard to deny the appeal of an oversized version of Scrabble® on a wood-framed Lazy-Susan. It might lure even jaded Words with Friends players to the table. At least that's my theory.
This season give your handheld device a rest and pull up a chair. You might even spark a true love of the non-digital world. Maybe.</p>

        <p>     I'm still continuing to receive great pix of the Drexel Heritage showroom last week's events. Had to share, as some of these are just sensational. When High Point Market rolls around the Coco Chanel tip "take one accessory off" rule need not apply when it comes to stylizing the showrooms. Merchandising is at a maximum and stylists use this as an opportunity to pull out all the stops.
Beyond the accessories... I always love the fabric selections they choose at Drexel. There's always a hint of curiosity there as I wonder how they imagined that combination and executed it so beautifully on their upholstery. Chintz and leather? Punchy florals and menswear stripes? Somehow they make the unimaginable combinations work.
Look closely: do you see what I see? Is fringe back? I'm thinking so. Big fringe. While we're on the subject or details, contrasting welt is coming at us full force this fall. It looks like we could all use a little decorative edging in our lives and living rooms.
In terms of color, Drexel offered two extremes. Deep saturation on one hand. Pale monochromatic colorways on the other. And the key things we can't ignore is that the rising star of the industry is the chair. Not the front. Not the cushion... but the sides and back. More on this in a future post. Not the circular wood frame on the chair above. Baby got back in a big way.
Up soon... some peeks at the Lane Venture showroom.</p>

        <p> As you may recall, my great friend Elaine Williamson stood in for me on the High Point Market blogger tour. She and some of my favorite online (and offline) friends were shown around in style by brand representatives and the High Point Market Authority themselves. An insider's look at new collections, the customization process and emerging market trends.
Her biggest surprise was her own response to Drexel Heritage. Elaine wasn't as familiar with the brand and was impressed by the depth of their customization options, the frames available throughout the collections and the very high end appeal of this brand.
{Full disclosure: my company does some professional work with Drexel's parent company Furniture Brands, as well as a few of this company's sister brands... but that doesn't alter the fact that I am a genuine fan of Drexel's seriously hot pieces.}
The frames, the fabric selection, the wide array of custom finishes, the designer trim... this is no ordinary brand. Drexel offers tradition with a massive dose of glamour thrown in just for the sheer fun of it.
Throw in glamorous pieces like this Cloe Lamp Table (which I desperately need in my living room right now) and I'm a fan for life. One of the creative geniuses behind the success of this brand is Denise Alala. If you've not been in the showroom to meet this gorgeous force of nature, you're missing out. It's clear she has design genius in her veins. A few Markets back I had the pleasure of walking solo with her through the showroom and was so impressed not only with her style outlook, but her ability to render that vision flawlessly into the finished product.
Much like Pearson's Jennifer McConnell, Denise has seems to have a peephole into the future of design. She's a step or two ahead of the rest of the crowd, and if you're not following her cues you're going to miss out and wonder what just happened without you.
For a tiny sample of this force at work, tune into the Drexel blog to see what she and Carl drum up next.</p>
