It helps when you are the principal partner in an illustrious design firm, but even with such credentials it's lovely to peer into Tino Zervudachi's Left Bank apartment. Art, antiquities and sculpture take center stage in each room. Neutrals reign supreme but there any plenty of pops of rich color to delight the eyes. Deep orange, vibrant pink, regal navy blue... all grounding and comforting. 
Tino's style philosophy can be summed up by this single statement, "If an interior doesn’t reflect the person who lives in it, the home becomes a showpiece," Poetically, by following his own design creed he has in fact created a magazine spread-worthy home. He may not call it a showpiece, but it's glorious nonetheless. Swing by AD for the rest of the tour and more on his incredible collection of treasured acquisitions. </div>

      	<div class="reading">



Ask anyone what they think of texas style and they'll probably guess oversized sofas with rolled arms, chenille fabric and nail heads galore. All in a mustardy brown tone in an over accessorized room. While there is some of that in every suburb in every state everywhere (not just Texas), I'm consistently amazed by the refined interiors of my fellow Texans. 
Cy Twombly art, sleek modern funishings and collected treasures are more commonplace than outsiders might guess. But I will confess that we do have a "thing" for comfort, gilded accents and - yes - nailhead trim alongside our Italian Empire acquisitions and Regency-style pieces. 
J. Randall Powers recently transformed an ordinary Houston home into an art-filled masterpiece. His own, I might add. While not every room in his residence boasts the more classic look I love, there is enough of a gallery-like feel throughout this residence to make me take note. Cubist paintings and Biedermeier settees live amicably on sisal rugs. It's an experiment in mixology that I think is a true success. 
What do I love best? The top photo offers several treats for the eyes. The Regency-style gilt-wood chairs, are cushioned with Hermès leather (I die) and are from Rose Tarlow Melrose House. Lovely enough, right/ but what I'm really coveting is that Italian Empire commode behind the table. Apparently the homeowner has two.. surely they could spare just one? 
See more of this lovely project at Arch Digest and read how he and his partner downsized their life and their acquisitions to fit into this home. It's a "less is more" story many will appreciate.

Old books, "found" objects, coral figurines... there's a universal craving for organic elements in our decor. The pendulum swings too shiny and glossy and we all go running for things that are imperfect, aged and distressed. It's the nature of things. Literally. 
Occasionally you find elements that straddle the line of organic and refined. These lovely items above do just that. Silver-edged cowry shell napkin rings, coral mounted on a polished base, a door embellishment with gilded edges. Man and nature combined to create perfectly imperfect things. 
Lovely!

It's officially autumn. Red and golden leaves on trees, even more fallen to the ground. Election day is upon us. There's a chill in the morning air. What does that mean? Fabulous fall fashion. 
Here are my top picks for versatile pieces to carry you through the season and into winter. 1. chiffon trimmed wool cape by Etro, 2. Gucci Napa leather gloves, 3. YSL Triboo booties
Whether you pair these with skinny jeans or a pencil skirt, you're sure to look perfectly polished and weather-ready. Now... go enjoy that blissful weather! </div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">We touched upon a few highlights of the Pearson showroom a few posts ago. Now it's time for me to show you my FAVORITE pieces. These are not necessarily new for this season, but these are undeniably great pieces anyone would love to have in their home. Ready? Here goes!</span><span style="color: #482c1b;"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;"> </span>
<br><br><span style="color: #482c1b; font-size: 10pt;">I'm sure you've seen this in my tweet stream... but really. Aqua &amp; emerald leopard print? If you'd described this to me I'd have said no way, no how, not happening. But in person this is so chic and tasteful. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b; font-size: 10pt;">Jennifer McConnell, VP of Design for Pearson must have been thrilled with this find when she went sourcing for fabrics. What a special textile! The second pic of it offers best color representation. Believe me, it is beautiful in person and touchably soft.</span> It's so luxe. <br><span style="color: #482c1b;"></span><br><span style="color: #482c1b;">Gilded etagere goodness. Just look at that gleaming gold. What I love about the finish is its irregularities. It is not a flat gold, it is not a highly polished gold. It is bronz-sh and gold and textured and rippled and just so incredibly interesting to see and touch. This particular finish sets Pearson's gilded pieces apart from other brands. It is very unique and exudes quality. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">So pairing it with back-painted glass beveled shelving to make these etageres is a stroke of genius. Lovely. So lovely. The perfect spot for those beloved art books &amp; acquired treasures. </span><br><span style="color: #482c1b;"></span><br><span style="color: #482c1b;">Umm... hello, gorgeous? What I'm loving: the contrasting welt &amp; front panel fabric, the sophisticated finish (it's Pearson's "Linen" finish which is off-white with beige speckles &amp; spots. stunning) and of course, the curvaceous lines of this versatile bench. SO yummy in this tangerine feather fabric. Wow!</span><br><span style="color: #482c1b;"></span><br><span style="color: #482c1b;">Bar cart goodness. Why is this handsome fellow in my spotlight? First, note that lovely shagreen tray top. Would you guess that the tray itself is removable? Yes. What strikes me most about this piece is its sophistication and impressive size. It's also surprisingly sturdy, thanks to its non-folding frame. I just can't get enough of this special little occasional piece. Might need to add this to my entertaining arsenal. </span><br><span style="color: #482c1b;"></span><br><span style="color: #482c1b;">Again this gilded finish makes me so happy. What's clever about this table is the double shelf thing happening. If that grid is too pretty to conceal (and it is) you can place your books and decorative boxes on the lower shelf, leaving the top free and clear for admiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">
<br>Ahh, my favorite Pearson chest. Isn't he handsome? There's a Barbara Barry quality happening here. That curved front silhouette. The Regency hardware. It is fuss-free with clean lines and a deep glossy finish that makes my knees buckle. I have ben admiring this same chest for years now. At a certain point I need to step up to the plate and hand over some of my hard earned cash to own one. And did you notice that hidden shelf that pulls out at the top? So chic. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">
<br>Here you get to see some of the hidden "traditional" cravings that I harbor. I can't explain my crush on this demilune, but it is design perfection to me. Long sleek legs with brass ferrule endings. Beautiful primavera veneers, delicate hardware and a petitie footprint. I mean, you could put one of these anywhere in your home. It's just such a lovely piece. I step up to admire it every time I'm in the showroom. It's the best example I've seen of a classic French demilune. Perfection. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">
<br><br>While we're on the subject of self-indulgence... dream with me for a moment about this desk. Isn't she pretty? I've been crushing on this little antique for years. It appeared a while back in a Pearson catalogue when they introduced their headboards for the first time. I liked it then, I LOVE it now. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">Here's the thing: it's an actual antique and the price is heartbreaking. But isn't she pretty? Let's all just take a moment to admire her before she must return to the antique market for complete strangers to paw. 
<br>Eglomise goodness! This little table is so chic. She's tiny. About 14" in diameter on a gilded tripod base. I love this little occasional piece. I could find excuses to tuck one in every corner of my home. So glamorous.<br><br>Here's the thing about design: most people err on the side of traditional with their upholstery in their home. But for occasional pieces like tables and cabinets? Anything goes. I think we are all bigger risk takers when it comes to our cocktail tables and accent pieces. This is what makes the Peason experience so rich for me. It's a mix of contemporary and classic that keeps us guessing. <br><br></span><span style="color: #482c1b;">Jennifer McConnell brilliantly combines the tried &amp; true with the edgy to keep us all guessing. She pushes the limit each and every Market. On top of that, she fearlessly mixes in wild textiles with classic fabrics for a showroom blend that is somehow timeless and "today" simultaneously. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">I see others try this approach, but maybe none nail it quite like Jennifer does. She puts it all out there and doesn't hold back. It's a lesson we all should learn from. Design your space - and your life - in a way that is the essence of you. Don't design to satisfy imaginary guests. How would YOU like to live? How would you like to feel moving through the rooms of your home? Design that space, that lifestyle and that mood. You deserve it. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #482c1b;">A note: for those who don't know, I'm the social media girl for Pearson. This post (and any post on my blog) is completely unsolicited and not a part of my role with Pearson. I'm just a fan. If you're a fan of luxury furnishings, follow me (as Pearson) on twitter, facebook and their blog.</span></p>

Life seems really "lively" right now. Every day there are enticing opportunities that almost make me want to shout yes. But given time to think and assess I realize that while tempting, they aren't in line with my true life goals, brand goals and the broader picture of all I am on the path to achieve. 
It's like this moment above in this photograph. Here comes Ina Balke, striding boldly in one direction full of purpose and joy. Suddenly, something grabs her attention to left. Maybe it's a friend. Maybe it's a man hoping to catch her eye. Maybe she's just looking at oncoming traffic. Who knows. Meanwhile her companion dog has come to a complete stop and is sitting on the sidewalk braced to resist any movement. It's a curious ug of war between the direction she's like to go, the one who's intent on holder her back and whatever is occupying her attention to the left. 
What is she not doing? Looking in the direction in which her feet are pointing. 
Unshackle yourself today from anything or anyone with intent to stop your progress. Trust your intuition. You KNOW what is best for you, your brand, your business, your family, yourself. Look boldly in the direction you are going and march forward. 
And when those opportunities arise (as they do), take a moment or two (or three) to weigh their long term value. Are they in line with your larger life plan? Will they help you achieve the happiness you deserve? Are they mutually beneficial, or are you really just being asked to work hard so that someone else reaps the benefits? 
If not, hold that pretty head of your high and keep on moving forward on your intended path. Trust yourself. Happiness awaits.

<br><br><br><br><br>I think most of us in the designer and design blog world have a crush on Hickory Chair. There's the cache of acquiring pieces designed by such notable figures as Mariette Himes Gomez, Suzanne Kasler, Thomas O'Brien and Alexa Hampton. There are lovely pieces that function almost as jewelry to a space. Gilded stools, perfectly designed desks, chic settees, elegant chairs. I love so many pieces from this brand. </p>
<p>The collections have certainly evolved since my first encounter with Hickory Chair years ago. There's a more modern element sliding into place. But for me, Hickory will always be my go-to brand for old world glamour and elegance. If these photos aren't convincing enough, get thee to the nearest showroom to be completely wowed. I assure you, you'll fall in love!</p>
<p>Thank you, Laura Holland, for gathering so many of us together during Market for a private tour of the new introductions and the opportunity to see the designers again. It is always a pleasure!</p>

<p>if you haven't yet made it over to the fall issue of TRADhome, please do not delay. Especially if you love white, bright and luminous spaces. These lovely images above reaffirmed my love of all things ivory for the home. Are we a home with children and pets? Yes. Am I a perfectionist? Yes. Can I help it that I passionately love creamy white interiors? No ma'am. It's really the perfect color. And it's even better if highlighted with gilded, gleaming accents. Lucky me, this was just the case in these dreamy rooms featured in the fall issue of this lovely digital mag.</p>
<p>Don't let my incredibly biased post fool you. The issue was full of rich, vibrant color. But my well-trained eyes zoomed right into what I wanted to see... the bright expanses of upholstery that beckoned. </p>

Center Table with intricate marquetry by Maitland-SmithElegant ebony recamier with painted gold accents sby Maitland-Smith
Hand Carved Mahogany Empire Armchair with Gold Metal Leaf Swan Accents by Maitland-SmithI can't gush enough about my trip to Maitland-Smith this year. The individual pieces were just exquisite. In addition to a few pieces I mentioned in a previous post, here were some of the items that still have dreaming. 
Italian Empire chairs,  an elegant recamier that leaves me imagining myself a lady of leisure in another era, a center table with beautiful inlaid marquetry (I LOVE this table) and of course... that glamorous cream settee in the top photo. My office chair is actually the sister product to that settee. I adore it! It is just as chic in person as one might expect, with hand-painted finish and gold accents. 
The Maitland experience is a bit like walking through the antiquities section of a top ranked museum. Individual pieces are so lovely and unique that you can't imagine them being produced by anyone in our impatient generation. You're almost expecting to see a plaque located nearby explaining that this was one of Marcus Aurelius's campaign pieces borrowed from the Louvre. They are just that lovely.

Another example of something I'd never have done myself, but I'm thrilled when I see it. Croc embossed leather in teal and chocolate look AMAZING on this classic French Bergere chair. The nailhead detail adds an extra bit of edge. 
The ombre effect of this pillow was subtle enough to make it feel classic. This fabric seemed to be the perfect marriage of Ikat and Flock in neutral tones. And note: fringe was everywhere this season. Something to remember when designing your upholstered pieces. 
Although this photo focuses on the lovely tablescaping in the foreground, I'm actually vibing on the mixed use of fabrics on the sofa behind it. Note the neutral base fabric, the pretty blue silk trellis cushion and the more ethnic lumbar pillow. There's a lot going on and it all mixes beautifully to produce an elegant and classic sofa. 
More of Denise's savvy textile mixtures and... note that AMAZING travertine topped table. Mais oui! I don't see him on the web site yet so he must be new... but he's handsome. I love the coppery bronze legs and the lower shelf. Perfect for holding more art books.In my Drexel post I commented on many of their lovely silhouettes and the general atmosphere of the showroom. But when I look back at what I most drooled over in High Point, Drexel Heritage's fabrics come to mind. 
Denise Alala, VP of Upholstery Design for the brand, provides a magical mix of textures and colors that are sexy without being overtly feminine or masculine. There are touches of glamour delivered by shimmering surfaces and touchable textures. But you'll also see handsome plaids and classic patterns that transcend styles and decades. 
I really appreciate Denise's ability to consistently select pretty textiles that also have wonderful hand. I would summarize the Drexel Heritage look as "sensible sophistication." You get the impression that these aren't just pleasant to look at, they are designed with quality and durability in mind.

I must be a very lucky girl. It's been years since I've had a bad or woefully uninformed client. These days I'm all smiles with my current roster of fun, smart people who encourage me "do my thing" for them with no restrictions. But anyone in a creative field presenting designs to a client can appreciate these hilarious posters based upon project feedback. Seeing as I'm up putting the finishing touches on a project at 6am on a Saturday, these were the perfect complement to my morning espresso. Enjoy!{via Sharp Suits}</div>

Barbara Barry Realized for HenredonIt's been a few weeks now since market. I've had time to write other posts and peer at my photos again. Time and time again I have been oohing and ahhing over the same key pieces, so I've decided to share them with you. Versatile Console/Dining table from HenredonFirst up, this magnificent trestle table from Henredon. What is initially interesting about this table is its multilayered finish. But take a closer look at this lovely console and you'll discover that is is actually a generously sized dining table that folds in half lengthwise. Genius. 
I had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Chris Bergelin, the design force behind many of Henredon's magnificent pieces. It is always a treat to hear how the creative process works for others. Chris and his son run Bergelin Design and produce a significant number of pieces for Henredon each season. Innovative ideas like this are sure to keep high-end buyers coming back again and again. 
Stairstep silhouette chest from Henredon Like most luxury brands, you won't find suites of furniture. Henredon offers special pieces in every conceivable option. Did you know that each piece of hardware is designed specifically for each piece of Henredon furniture? There are no shared hardware options. The sheer variety that produces across the product line is astonishing. I loved the attention to detail on the individual pieces in this showroom, but what really wowed me was that Chris and his team produce items that fall on every range of the design spectrum. There are modernist upholstered pieces alongside large scale traditional bookcases. It's masterfully done and beautiful to see.

I die over this perfectly proportioned lamp table. Just look at that intricate inlay on the top and those pretty little ferruled feet. J'adore!Pearson offers what is quite possibly the world's most perfect Bergere. I'm looking to add one of these to my living room in a linen stripe fabric with ultra-plush down fill. I think every home could use one of these!
I LOVE this chest. It offers understated French style with a petite size, tapered legs and a serpentine shape (which you can't appreciate from this front view. I really love this Pearson chest. Imagine using these as bedside chests. So pretty.  Pearson never disappoints when it comes to French-inspired pieces.I've shown a few of mine above just to give you a sense. There's a "newness" to each of these pieces that I can appreciate. I especially pine for this magical three drawer chest you see above. I can't quite explain it but I'm obsessed with this piece. It comes in any finish you can imagine... I'm curious to see one in the new white finish they just introduced. Magnifique! 

Drexel Heritage offers this pitch perfect Cloe table from the Et Cetera collection. Brass, eglomise and glamour coalesce to create a lamp table I've drooled over for way too long. Lucky me? She was even prettier in person! I'll continue this roundup in a second post.. but before I go, stop to appreciate this incredible eglomise table from Drexel Heritage. I have coveted this table for about two years now. Notice the hooved feet, the rings on the top of the legs and the secondary shelf. This pretty little table from their Et Cetera collection in many ways sums up my style. I think it is perfect in every imaginable way. Might need to own one sooner rather than later. </div>

I'm thrilled yet astonished at the success of DryBar in Dallas. Walk in. Get an absolutely perfect blowout. Pay a very reasonable $35. Walk out looking FABULOUS in about a half an hour. I mean... it's my new favorite thing. Dallas takes many things seriously and one of them is hair. I'm not terribly surprised by the success, but I am amazed at how responsive owner Alli Webb has been to the demand. 
If you happen to have a DryBar in your city, don't waste another moment. Also: their iPhone app is one of the best I've seen. A few finger touches and you're booked. Easy peasy. </div>

I still remember my first trip to Maitland-Smith several years ago. How do you explain such a brand to those who aren't familiar? Do they design furniture? Do they design lamps? Do they design accessories? I now know the answer. They design objets d'art. They truly do. Each and every piece is painstakingly detailed and completely beautiful. Let me show you some of my favorites... 



First, the Renaissance Chaise. There's not a single element I'd wish to change about this piece. It is lovely and amazing. I sat on this piece in the showroom during High Point Market and felt so very Zsa Zsa Gabor. All I need is a white fur coat, bigger diamonds and a glass of champagne. Garçonne!

And now for the desk that made my knees weak. Both of these pieces were from what they had dubbed the "Socialite" grouping. Like the chaise above, this desk has deep European influences and conjures images of a cosmopolitan lifestyle where the heftiest task of the day is ordering fresh flowers and penning a few thank you notes. An enviable life and exquisite furnishings to complement such a lifestyle. This beautiful desk has a leather top and a curvaceous silhouette. It is so incredibly pretty. Wouldn't this make the loveliest blogging perch? I have to say yes. 

As I toured the showroom at High Point Market, I came across a few entire areas that made me gasp. First was the Prep School room. If ever a room made me think of Mr. Venti, this was it! Think varsity sports, academia and long discussions about pre-Renaissance Greek history. If you imagine fresh faced young men in khaki pants and navy blue wool blazers with brass buttons, you've nailed the vibe of this incredible room. Each piece individually designed and crafted to perfection. 
This particular table above is stunning in person. In an aged Regency finish, it has a reeded single pedestal on a tri-pod base. But the crowning glory of the table is its heraldic lion inlaid top. Isn't that gorgeous? Such unique detail done in such a tasteful way. My husband would LOVE this occasional piece. Ten year anniversary, perhaps? I'll keep that in mind when it rolls around. 



I could go on forever about the many wonders of Maitland-Smith, but what you really need to know is that they are magical. They offer everything imaginable. Incredible lamps, surprisingly modern pieces, accessories so luxurious they'll please the most discerning client, upholstery... the list goes on. They inventory is rich and interesting and is clearly designed with the true luxury clientele in mind. 
Bonnie Cedolia, the Marketing Coordinator for the brand, was so gracious with her time. She patiently walked me through a personal tour of the showroom and answered my many questions about the brand. As you might guess, clients who come to this showroom tend to write their orders in the spot. These items are so unique and so intricate that it would be impossible to remember the details once returning home. Knowing this, they cater to this need and make it easy for their well-heeled clientele to stroll through the showroom identifying the specific treasures they'll take back to their firms, department stores and showrooms. 
Maitland-Smith is truly an experience of its own. I can't say enough wonderful things about the products or the staff. I know the pieces I've shown above focus on their old world glamour, but Maitland has a surprisingly diverse product mix. Mid-Century influenced collections, Art-Deco and contemporary silhouettes are all a part of their offerings.I think now you can see why I say they design objets d'art rather than furniture or accessories. You go to Maitland-Smith for items of quality and design so uncommon that you simply won't find them anywhere else. It's what draws their clients from all regions of the world to come see them at High Point. There simply isn't another brand quite like them.   
Thank you, Bonnie, for your incredible hospitality. You are so well-informed and so generous with your time and attention. I cannot wait to add more Maitland-Smith to my home, and I look forward to seeing you again soon!  </div>

       	<div class="reading">Trending at Market: hair on hide. It was everywhere. This chair was one of the best examples I've seen of the trend. Love the placement of such organic elements around such a finely crafted French style chair.
Another element seen repeatedly at Market: the quatrefoil. Rarely, however, is an entire piece of furniture formed in this classic shape. I loved this versatile occasional piece. Bedside chest, end table, accent table... you name it, this piece could fill that role. A really beautiful element in any room.
 A stunning sofa rests in the bqckground with fabulous cream frame and blue trellis bench seat. Of course the styling in the showroom, as seen on the cocktail table in the foreground, is so good you simply have to stop and admire the grouping.  Always the best part of any showroom visit: the resource room! Drexel realy turns it out when it comes to fabric samples. I'd love to have my own fabric swatch inventory arranged this way in my home office. Isn't this delicious? 
And of course, a French sofa with an incredible silhouette and a Gustavian Gray finish. I do have a weakness for these linen covered pieces with European stylng. A truly beautiful upholstered piece. And isn't that rug yummy?Zebra, anyone? This particular fabric has an ombre effect to it, with the stripes having more intensity of color in the center and fading out slightly at the edges. Note how it was placed on this classic chair finished in silver leaf. Serious pop of drama. 
One of the showroom tours I was most looking forward to at Market was Drexel Heritage. I've had a soft spot for in my designer heart for years for this brand. I love the sheer variety of the showroom and it's artisan appeal. But much of this stems from my appreciation of the talent of their creative director Denise Alala. She is one half of the creative team behind this luxurious furniture brand and never ceases to amaze me with her ability to evolve and surprise when it comes to new introductions for High Point Market.
Drexel Heritage doesn't have a "look" or a style. Their collections run the gamut between classic European pieces (like bergeres and French settees) and on-trend designs that clearly derive influences from runway fashion and modern culture (as is the case with the zebra &amp; silver leaf chair above). It's this delicious visual melange that keeps your eyes from ever tiring during a showroom tour. Beyond every corner is a vignette in a completely different look that the one you just passed through. 
The unifying quality, of course, is the "collected" look that Drexel does so well. Each piece is offered in a seemingly endless array of finishes. Have that iron bed painted chippy antique white or do it up in rich red. The choice is yours and the showroom reflects this attention to personalization. Their upholstery selection knows no bounds either. From shimmering wovens to vibrant prints, the beauty of their textiles is always a treat for the eyes. 
Beyond what they offer, the mood at Drexel is always quite sexy. Lights are dimmed just so. Vignettes are styled so richly that you want to move right in. It's such a lush space that you want to occupy not just the space but the lifestyle that the styling implies. Design books are scattered about, fresh flowers are scattered about in vases, art supplies are gathered here and there. This is what good showroom styling is all about. Drexel is selling an artisan lifestyle and I love it. 
While I was there I was able to spend time with longtime online (and now real) friend Stacey Bewkes of Quintessence Blog, Ronda Rice Carman of All the Best Blog (a VERY longtime online friend whom I've finally had the pleasure to meet &amp; spend time with) as well as the always lovely Meg BIram of Mimi and Meg. This was a fantastic group of girls to be on tour with and it was so nice to finaly get that offline time with "my girls" - especially in a stylish environment like the Drexel space. 
Thank you, Denise for the tour and for your time.  And thank you, Lisa Hanly of Furniture Brands for inviting me to come play at Drexel! 
If you have a Drexel Heritage showroom in your city, please go visit. The variety of styles and personalization choices will astonish you. Each piece truly is crafted to your specificiations. Stay tuned in the next few weeks to my twitter &amp; facebook feeds, as I'll be posting even more snaps from my tour. Many lovely photos to share with you. </div>
