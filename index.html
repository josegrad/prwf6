I was admiring the Tory Burch estate photos the way one admires overly fussy cuisine. I liked it. I appreciated it for all its complexity... but it just wasn't to my taste. Patterns... lots of them. Prints. Chintz. And more pedigreed pieces than most people will encounter in their time here on earth.
And then... I happened upon these photos of her pool house and the grandeur that is her outdoor living space. Consider me sold. I decided right then and there that if I had to take this property as-is I would do it just for the phenomenal poolside lifestyle.
Might I add... the property is stunning. Absolutely stunning... I would just need to start anew with the interior design to live there myself. But Tory... what a lovely retreat you've created for yourself. I applaud your incredible success and the incredible life you have created for yourself. And as for that pool house? I do hope you entertain their frequently... it's a magical addition to your home. </div>

<p>While I'm not your typical full blown Kate Spade fan, I do love her ability to consistently churn out poppy, happy items. Her latest foray into home goods that serve up Jonathan Adler-worthy "anti-depressive" items is her Florence Broadhurst collection. Be sure to check out the full d√©cor shop to see just how positively cheerful this basic pairing of colors can be when used to display Japanese blossoms. It's downright giddy if you ask me!</p>My pick? The tableware, of course. And while there is no espresso cup available, I love the idea of adding these "tidbit" plates to serving arsenal for a party. </div>

      	<div class="reading">Because I (and I'm guessing you as well) can't resist an opportunity to peer into a fabulous closet, may I offer you a glimpse into the master closet of this $6.5MM University Park listing. The home itself is just under 9,000 square feet and is in one of my favorite parts of Dallas.
Yahoo describes the home (and mostly the closet) this way:

This house, built in 2007, almost looks like a converted warehouse from  outside. Highlights include an underground garage, marble floors and  fireplaces, and a geothermal HVAC system. The master bedroom has his and  hers baths, along with this enormous closet with high ceilings. The  closet has shelving for shoes and cowboy boots, as well as overhead storage for hats and out-of-season clothing.

I will say, Dallas homes have some of the best closets I've ever seen. We are willing to have smallish yards in order to accommodate our need for generous square footage inside the home and maximum storage space. For more fabulous real estate drool sessions, be sure to peruse one of my favorite sites, Mathews Nichols for some of the city's finer examples of luxury homes. This listing ought to get you started. Note the insanely pretty kitchen and dreamy back patio. This is what living in the South is all about. </div>

      	<div class="reading">Celebrity designer Christian Louboutin's highly anticipated capsule collection is now available. Twenty shoes to celebrate twenty years of craftsmanship and artistry. And - it bears mentioning - six celebratory bags.
I am absolutely swooning over the illustrations - far more than the anniversary collection shoes themselves. There's no denying he is a force of nature too powerful to be stopped. Here's a man who knows how to absolutely seduce an audience. Not only would I gladly take a closet filled with his shoes, I'd love a few walls adorned with his illustrations as well. The question is... which is more closely regarded as art? The conceptual sketch or the real thing? You be the judge.

      	<div class="reading">If you've been lax on your Reformer classes or skipping those Bar Method sessions... let me warn you that spring is nearly upon us and you'll have nowhere to hide once that calendar hits March. Have you seen the fresh looks I'm seeing? Curve hugging goodness, girls! Platform shoes, to-die-for dresses (in that yummy knee-length) and most importantly: waistlines! This season's looks showcase your best assets and believe me you'll want to be toned and fabulous to rock these looks.
It;s not about being skinny... in fact, I think these looks are all about celebrating a woman's curves. In at the waist and va-va-voom at the hips. Play up your best features and you'll be good to go.
Because I adore them, Isabella Oliver is my (not so) secret source for items that won't be seen all over town. The secret of course is their jersey and their commitment to showcasing rather than hiding the body. Spring 2012 does NOT disappoint. And more importantly... COLOR is here! Pink, blue, orange... I love it. Of course I've only shown you a sliver of the collection, but these were four looks I absolutely must have. Visit their site for the full array of goodies (including those incredible leopard accessories shown in the bottom right look). And seriously... hit those classes. Confidence is the most appealing thing a woman can wear!</div>

      	<div class="reading">Hard to comprehend that Christian Louboutin has been crafting his masterful creations for two decades. I say this largely because his brand has only been a household name for the better part of this decade. And yet, his creative genius has been focused on fine tuning the craftsmanship of shoes for twenty years. What an anniversary!
If the thought of $1000+ footwear makes you and your financial planner woozy, might I suggest the book that celebrates their design? It's the savvy girl's ticket to fabulously hot footwear while still keeping her Benjamins cool.
If, on the other hand, money is no object... I adore these croc-sequined peep-toe pumps that beguile me with their shmmery luster. By the way, I wear a size 6. ;)
For up to the moment Louboutin news, be sure to follow them on twitter. Always many in-store appearances and festive events happening around the globe.</div>

      	<div class="reading">  Milly's spring 2012 collection is playful, geometric and in-your-face fun. There's no denying that a lineup of looks like this begs for fabulous vacation plans, oversized sunglasses and shoes, shoes, shoes! I'm not completely on board with the colors (navy just isn't a color I enjoy), but I do like the Mondrian-influenced prints, the waist-whittling silhouettes and the flat out modern approach to dressing.
I see belts, slim pants, cropped jackets and pretty sundresses. All with structure we've been sorely missing for several seasons. As usual, runways shows such as these have me considering my leg routine and longing to rub on some self tanner. But mostly, they make me happy that spring will surely come surprise us soon with long sunny days and an invitation to wear color, color and more color.

If a picture is worth 1000 words, this post has already exceeded your attention span. Perhaps knowing that this gem of a boutique hotel is offering a private sale on bookings will rouse you from your slumber.
With interior style served up by Paris's Bambi Sloan, this h√¥tel particulier surrounded by a privacy wall and garden will astound even the most well-heeled traveler. It manages to be both quirky and utterly posh at the same time (which is a good thing, as I'm not so keen on quirk but an undying slave to posh).
But back to that private garden. Though enjoyable by day, it is a sight best taken in at night. Imagine fine dining under the stars in Paris's 16th arrondissment. Your surroundings (and company) decidedly genteel. You'll feel transported to the countryside yet all the while be surrounded by some of the city's most prestigious real estate. 
Book quickly, however. This 48 room ch√¢teau can be depended upon to draw a crowd. You'll want to ensure there's room for you at the inn, lest ye be locked outside the private walls of this remarkable property. Full details at tablet.com. </div>

       	<div class="reading">Ahhh, fragrance. Is there any faster way to alter a mood and a mindset? I think not. While there are as many different scents out there as there are preferences, one thing is certain: finding one that speaks to you and "moves" you is key.
One think many women (and men) overlook is the variety of methods for applying personal fragrance. Are you a scented powder kid of girl, a solid parfum person or a body oil babe? The difference in quality and enjoyment of the fragrance based upon the application might surprise and delight you.
I find it most rewarding to layer my scents, thereby creating my own unique fragrance. Try this: Bobbi Brown's Beach Oil followed by Gucci II eau de toilette (now discontinued, but I have my own stash!) with a dab of Tocca Brigitte solid perfume on the insides of your wrist. Result: aromatic intoxication... in the best possible way.
For the uninitiated... don't miss out on one of life's true great pleasures. Fr√©d√©ric Malle's line of fragrances is a mesmerizing blend of high-tech innovation and the best natural extractions of exotic (and familiar) essences. Introductions like Carnal Flower are impossible to describe in words. Suffice it to say, the 18 lengthy months it took to create the fragrance was well worth it. You (and your romantic interest) will be thrilled you experimented with this mind blowing aroma. It's like nothing you've ever tried before. Rush to your local Barneys counter and sample the goods. It's worth the effort.
The best tip I can offer you about selecting your own unique fragrance is this: choose on that YOU love. Never wear a fragrance for someone else. If it makes you feel romantic or powerful or sophisticated or dangerous... if it moves you, alters your state and makes you feel amazing: by all means wear it! Remember nothing is as appealing as confidence, and when you find your small stable of mood altering scents consider yourself armed for any challenge life (or love) may toss your way.

I could never understand the girls who grumbled and griped about Valentine's Day. As they day approached they grew more bitter. Truth is, these were pessimestic people to begin with... and the impending day of romance was just one more excuse to draw attention to their distaste for life in general.
The thing is, romance is a lot like joy and happiness. It's your responsibility - not that of someone else to manifest this in your life. It's something you experience, not something someone does for you. Frankly, some of my best Valentine's Day were those I enjoyed as a single girl. It's a day when you can add a bit more lip gloss, higher heels, have a bit more of a spring in your step, wear pink without irony and - yes, even buy yourself a massive bouquet of your favorite Stargazer lilies.
Being happy and embracing your femininity is your responsibility. Waiting on some white knight to "rescue" you is putting undue responsibility on someone else. Joy and satisfaction comes from within. And how could you be anything less than happy in a deliciously pink pencil skirt?.
So I say, single or not, treat yourself to something fun this holiday. Maybe it's a tube of gorgeous gloss. A pedicure. Maybe it's a handbag you've been coveting. Maybe it's dinner and drinks with the girls... maybe it's just some time out for yoga. Whatever it is, realize that the onus is on you to manifest your own happiness today and every day in life. Not that of Mr. Right. 


Frankly, nothing is more appealing to a man than a confident, happy, self-satisfied woman. So be that woman. And in festive pink with a broad smile on your glowing face, you'll be hard to miss and impossible to resist.</div>

       	<div class="reading">Suffice it to say: she rocked the house. I have never been impressed with a halftime show, but seeing Madonna in all her Givenchy and Philip Treacy glory had me on the edge of my seat. She looked gorgeous, glamorous and - perhaps best of all - as though she was having the time of her life. I mean, if you are carried in on a golden throne being held by 100+ buffed and bronzed centurions, surely you should be wearing a smile that bright. That, dear readers, is how a true performer entertains a massive live audience.
While I could go on and on about her appearance (stunning) and her glorious outfits (incredible), I'd be doing you a disservice. For an in depth study of her sartorial choices, be sure to see Nice Verreos's post on last night's Super Bowl costumes. There he dissects her costumes and discusses her wise choice of using stylist Bea √Ökerlund to craft her look.
And since I know you're eager to do so, you can pre-order the new MDNA album here.

As you might know, I'm a bit obsessed with keen on organization. A to do list is an absolute must to actually accomplish both daily goals and long term plans. My secret weapon? A fabulous notebook and a blue Papermate pen. However... I find that an app is an indispensable tool that I (now) can't live without. After all, most ideas occur when you're out and about.
Enter Clear from tap tap tap. Not available yet... but one look at this video and you'll agree - iPhone users need this! Look at that sinfully clean interface and the ease of use. It looks like an interactive dream come true.
This is surely on my "must have" list. </div>

Your favorite Sephora cast member will no longer greet you in a staid black ensemble. Expect to see a flash of red and a much more sleek silhouette as envisioned by hotter than hot designer Prabal Gurung.
Before continuing, I must confess... I've been a huge fan of Prabal's since long before he became so popular. In 2010 he made an appearance here in Dallas at the flagship Neiman Marcus and I jumped at the chance to see his collection. He was already on the popularity upswing at that point, but it was one of those moments when you knew you were standing in the presence of greatness before the whole world fully caught on.
Fast forward to today and he - and his fresh modern aesthetic - have taken the fashion world by storm. He has truly become the darling of design, and having examined some of his more elaborate pieces in person, I can assure you that his craftsmanship and attention to detail are a large factor in his success. Add that to his healthy good looks, easy and magnanimous demeanor and his ability to consistently produce imaginative collections and you've described the combo that has taken the fashion world by storm.
Now... on to those updated uniforms for your male or female favorite beauty expert. Here's what BellaSugar has to say:

Designer Prabal Gurung has just previewed the new uniforms he designed for Sephora,  and they're a big change from the plain black ensembles you're used to  seeing. Now, male "cast members" will have their choice of sleek, black  separates with red detailing, and women will be wearing fitted pantsuits  with blazers or black trapeze dresses with red accents. The classic  palette and sophisticated feel of the new attire is chic, and there's  something a little futuristic about the styling, too. All in all, it's a  Prabal Gurung collection beauty aficionados are sure to see frequently.

How this will impact the beauty peddler's bottom line is hard to say. But the updated look will surely energize the staff and the overall appearance of the store. That flash of red - like the heel of a Louboutin - adds much needed zing to the full black outfit. Be sure to see the video of these fetching outfits in person. </div>

If there's one thing you should know about my great city, it's that Dallas is a city that loves to shop. There's a nonstop round of society events in the works, celebrity appearances, famous athletes, benevolent billionaires and all-around fabulous people to mix and mingle with nightly. Because of this, fashion is and always will be key to the city's bustling social scene.
Thankfully, there are always fabulous sales and trunk shows helping you look your best and still maintain the required minimum balance in your bank account.
One "not to be missed" event is the FIG (that's Fashion Industry Gallery) Finale sale, which only happens twice each year. Imagine having access to Gucci at 75% off. That's right. Gucci. Serious shoppers will want to opt for the VIP package. For $50 you'll be granted early access to the sale at a private party, complimentary cocktails, hors d‚Äôoeuvres, live dj spun tunes and complimentary valet parking. First dibs on luxury loot and a night of festivities, not a bad bargain if you ask me!
Here's the skinny on the sale happening February 9, 10 and 11. Sign up soon while tickets are still available. </div>
